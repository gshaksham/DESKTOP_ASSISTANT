## DESKTOP_ASSISTANT
The Voice Assistant project is a sophisticated system designed to execute tasks based on user voice commands, such as answering queries, device connectivity, and performing specific actions like opening Google or playing music. It leverages the power of Python to emulate the functionality of voice-enabled assistants, enabling users to conveniently interact with digitalized tasks. By integrating mobile phone capabilities, users can remotely control their desktop, while ensuring a secure environment through login authentication, limiting failed login attempts to three to prevent unauthorized access.
